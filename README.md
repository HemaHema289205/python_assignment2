task1:
     In this task we use if-else condition statement to know whether the user input is even or odd number.
     The working mechanism of if-else statement is it check the condition that it present in if statement if it correct then print the statement under the if     4
     condition else it print statement under the else condition.
     num=int(input('Enter a number: '))
     if num%2==0:
        print(f'{num} is an even number.')
     else:
        print(f'{num} is an odd number.')
 task2:
     In this task we print sum of range of numbers by using for loop and range function.
     sum=0
     for i in range(1,51):
          sum+=i
     print(f'The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: {sum}')
